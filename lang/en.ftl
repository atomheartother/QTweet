  Hey, {$count} isn't a number! >:c

  Nice try~

  {-b}You're asking for a lot of tweets{-b}

  `{-pr}tweet {$screenName} --count={$count} --force`

tweetNotAuthorized =
  {-b}I tried getting a tweet from {$screenName} but Twitter tells me that's unauthorized.{-b}
  This is usually caused by a blocked account.

  {$error}

  Remember you can stop me at any time with `{-pr}stop {$nameCount ->
    [1] {$firstName}
    *[other] <{-screen-name-variable}>

    [0] {""}
    *[other] It also appears I was unable to find some of the users you specified, make sure you used their screen name!

noSuchTwitterUser =
  {-b}I can't find {$count ->
    [1] a Twitter user by the name of

    [1] handle
    *[other] handles
  }.

tooManyUsersRequested =

  It seems I requested too many users to twitter. This shouldn't happen, but in the meantime try requesting fewer users!

### Posting errors

  {-b}Missing Permissions:{-b} I couldn't send a message in {$name}.
  If a mod could give me the {-b}Send Messages{-b}, {-b}Send Embeds{-b} and {-b}Attach Files{-b} permissions there that would be nice.
  If you'd like me to stop trying to send messages there, moderators can use `{-pr}stopchannel {$id}`.
  If you think you've done everything right but keep getting this message, join our support server, it's linked in my `{-pr}help` message.

### User Limit D:
userLimit =
  {-b}I've hit my user limit!{-b} Your subscription request contained accounts no one else is subscribed to, so I had to drop them.

  {-b}Why did you do this?{-b}
  Twitter currently limits every app to 5 000 subscriptions. If you're reading this I have reached that limit, and I have no choice - if I ask for more users then everything will break for everyone.

  {-b}What are you doing to fix this?{-b}
  I've been working really hard to try and find options to get out of this situation, and it's been very stressful for me, because I really want everyone to get their tweets. However so far no option seems perfect.
  You can find a thread on the topic here if you'd like to propose any solutions: https://github.com/atomheartother/QTweet/issues/32

  {-b}Can I help?{-b}
  If you read the thread I posted above, you'll see a lot of options will cost me money. If you'd like to help and make it possible for QTweet to function better for everyone, you can support QTweet's development on Patreon - every little bit helps: https://www.patreon.com/atomheartother

  {-b}How do I get my tweets in the meantime?{-b}
  You have a few options if you really want these accounts posted to your server:
  - {-b}Host your own version of QTweet{-b}: I would really recommend doing this, QTweet is free and open source, and you can run her from any computer or server. You can read more in the `!!help` message and contact my creator if you need help.
  - {-b}Remove some of your subscriptions{-b} if you have any, to free up some space - note that if another server is subscribed to that account this will not work unfortunately.
  - {-b}Find an alternative to QTweet{-b}: Yup, that's it, if those options don't work for you I'm afraid I can't do anything else for you!

### Temporary/Urgent stuff
slashCmdsWarning =
  :warning: {-b}Regular commands will soon be replaced by slash commands.{-b}
  Within a few weeks, {-bot-name} won't work with regular commands anymore as Discord is forcing all bots to move to slash commands.
  I recommend trying to use slash commands right now and reporting bugs to our support server if there's any issue!
